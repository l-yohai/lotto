## Project Description
This project focuses on training a multi-label classification model and sequence to sequence model using South Korean lottery number data. This project's goal is to predict future lottery numbers based on historical draws. I utilize Python, PyTorch, and the Hugging Face Transformers library for this purpose.

Disclaimer: This project is intended purely for entertainment purposes. Lottery draws are independent events, and the outcomes of previous draws have no bearing on future ones. This project should not be taken as a serious attempt to predict lottery numbers. Users are advised to view this as a reference and not to rely on it for gambling decisions.

***Additional Note***: Decisions to purchase lottery tickets based on this project's output are solely the responsibility of the viewer. The creator of this project bears no responsibility for any gambling decisions made based on the information provided here.
